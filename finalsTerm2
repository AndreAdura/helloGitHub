Algorithms, Flowcharts and problem solving
Final Exam

1.	Create an algorithm to get a series of numbers and by pressing 0 calculate the average of those numbers, then print the maximum, the minimum and the average number.
Variables:
a = number 1(input)
b = number 2(input)
c = number 3 (input)
average
minimum
medium 
maximum
divisor = number of inputs (in this case 3)

initialize
divisor = 3 (I can create a counter to calculate the divisor but the question is not asking for that, so I’ll declare it)
process
step 1 = ask for the numbers (input numbers a, b, c)
numbers was inputted? 
Yes – go step 2
No – go step 1
Step 2 = ask for input “0” ( print “press 0”)
0 was pressed?
No – Go step 2
Yes – Go step 3
Step 3 – process
 average = a+b+c / divisor

if (a > b and > c) { maximum = a }
if (b > a and > c) { maximum = b}
if (c > a and > b) [ maximum = c}
 
if (a < b and < c) { minimum = a }
if (b < a and < c) { minimum = b}
if (c < a and < b) [ minimum = c}

if (a =! minimum and maximum) { a = medium} 
if (b =! minimum and maximum) { b = medium} 
if (c =! minimum and maximum) { c = medium} 

step 4 – output
Print (The maximum number is “ maximum”, The average number is “ medium”, The minimum number is “ minimum” and the average of these numbers is “ average”)

2.	Create a flow chart that calculates the Pi based on the 10 first term of the following series 

4 - 4/3 + 4/5 - 4/7 + 4/9 - 4/11 + 4/13-…

3.	Create a simple VB, C or JavaScript program that calculates the factorial of a given number. 
JavaScript:
// while loop
var i=5, sum=1;

while(i> 0)
{
sum = sum* i; i -= 1;
}
alert(sum)





// for loop

var i=5, sum=1;
	

	for(i==5; i>0; i-=1)
	{
	sum *= i 
	}
	alert(sum);

4.	Create a flowchart for adding numbers from 1 to 1000 using Gauss method.
