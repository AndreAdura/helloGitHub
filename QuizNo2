a.	Create an algorithm to add all odd numbers from 1 to 100

variables

number
sum

initializing

number = 1
sum = 0



process
sum = sum + number 
              
if num < 99
  number = number + 2
if num = 99 
  print sum  

b.	Create an algorithm to add even numbers from 1 to 100

variables

number
sum

initializing

number = 2
sum = 0


process
sum = sum + number 
              
if num < 100
  number = number + 2
if num = 100
  print sum  

c.	Create an algorithm to add all numbers between 2 arbitrary numbers.

variables

a
b
sum

initializing

a = "arbitrary Number 1"
b = "arbitrary Number 2"
sum = 0 


process
sum = sum + a 
              
if a < b
  a = a + 1
if a = b
  print sum 

Part 2: Carl Friedrich Gauss was a German mathematician who invented a fast and efficient method for adding numbers between 1 and 100. 
You are required to read about his method and create an algorithm to add numbers between 1 and 100 using Gauss method.

variables
a
b
sum

initializing
a = 1
b = 100
sum = 0

process

sum = b * (b+1) / 2
