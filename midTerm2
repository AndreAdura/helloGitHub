1.	Create an algorithm to separate digits of a positive integer number and print the digits backward. 
Example:
Input 712
Output 2   1    7


variables

number (input)
chars (number of characters inputed)
x
counter


initialize
counter = 0
chars = number of inputs


process
step 1
number is integer(>0)?
NO - Print "not valid"

YES -Next step

step 2

counter ++ (counter increased by 1)
x = (chars) - (counter)
swap the first char to the right "x" times;  

step 4
char = counter ?

NO - step 2 again

Yes - print number






----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.	Create an algorithm that find the smallest coefficient of 7 where the remainder of its division to 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 is 1.
Hint: when you divide this number to 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 respectively the remainder of it should be one.

variables
counter
number 
x
a
b
c
d
e

initialize
number = 7
a = 2
b = 3
c = 4
d = 5
e = 6
counter = 1

process
counter ++ (increment by 1)

x = number * counter

if x % a,b,c,d,e = 1 print x
else process again








3.	Create an algorithm to get a radius for a base circle and a height of a cylinder and calculate the total area of the cylinder.

a = Area/total
r = radius
h = height 
pi = 3.14

formula
a = 2*pi*r * (r + h)

variables
a 
r 
h 
pi

initialize
r = "input radius value"
h = "input height value" 
pi = 3.14

process

ask inputs ( r,h)

if ( r,h != > 0)
a = 2*pi*r*(r+h)
print "a"

else
print " input a valid number for r,h "

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.	Create an algorithm to convert a binary number to a decimal number 
variable
number = input
decimal
char = number of characters inputed
counter
sum

process
counter = 0


step 1
is the number is binary?


NO - print " not valid"

YES - count the number of characters of the number

step 2
counter ++

is the number has more than 1 character?

NO - decimal = number * 2^0 , print decimal

YES - enumerate characters
calculate the character number "counter" 
sum  = 2^char - counter * character"counter"


step 3

is there another charater?

NO - decimal = result,  print decimal

YES - run step 2 again and summate the previous result(sum) of this step(2) with the current and print sum.
